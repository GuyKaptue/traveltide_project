segmentation:
  threshold_definitions:
    TOTAL_SPEND:
      column: total_spend
      quantile: 0.8
      fallback: 4000
      description: >
        Spend median ≈ 3343, mean ≈ 4179, 75% ≈ 5522.
        Using the 80th percentile (~5522) with fallback 4000 ensures
        only top spenders qualify, but fallback prevents thresholds
        from being too strict if data is sparse.

    TRIP_COUNT:
      column: num_trips
      quantile: 0.8
      fallback: 1.5
      description: >
        Trips median = 3, mean ≈ 2.68.
        Setting quantile at 0.8 (~4 trips) with fallback 1.5
        balances frequent travelers while avoiding exclusion
        when trip counts are low.

    BROWSING_RATE:
      column: browsing_rate
      quantile: 0.8
      fallback: 0.6
      description: >
        Browsing rate mean ≈ 0.66, median ≈ 0.625.
        Threshold at 0.8 (~0.78) captures high‑intent browsers,
        fallback 0.6 ensures average browsers are not excluded.

    HOTEL_SPEND:
      column: money_spent_hotel_total
      quantile: 0.8
      fallback: 1200
      description: >
        Hotel spend median ≈ 1213, mean ≈ 1831.
        80th percentile (~2446) targets heavy hotel spenders,
        fallback 1200 ensures typical hotel users qualify.

    BUSINESS_RATE:
      column: business_rate
      quantile: 0.8
      fallback: 0.2
      description: >
        Business rate mean ≈ 0.19, median = 0.0.
        80th percentile (~0.33) captures business travelers,
        fallback 0.2 ensures moderate business users are included.

    GROUP_RATE:
      column: group_rate
      quantile: 0.8
      fallback: 0.1
      description: >
        Group rate mean ≈ 0.027, sparse distribution.
        80th percentile often collapses to 0, so fallback 0.1
        ensures occasional group travelers qualify.

    AVG_BAGS:
      column: avg_bags
      quantile: 0.8
      fallback: 1.0
      description: >
        Avg bags median = 0.5, 75% = 1.0.
        80th percentile (~1.0) targets heavy baggage users,
        fallback 1.0 ensures perk assignment remains meaningful.
